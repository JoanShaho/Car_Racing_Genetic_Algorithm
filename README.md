# Car_Racing_Genetic_Algorithm

This is an implementation of the Genetic Algorithm along with Neural Networks using a car racing simulation. The cars constantly move forward but the direction and amount that each one turns is determined by a neural network. 

- **Neural Network inputs and outputs
- The inputs of the neural network are the intersection points between the track and the five directional lines (2 left, 2 right, and 1 straight) of the car. The outputs are two: the first one determines the direction the car should turn and the second the angle.
